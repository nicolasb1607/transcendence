	"classic": "In a bygone era, back on Earth, a classic game of pong emerged, capturing the hearts of a generation and evoking waves of nostalgia. This timeless game took place in the simplicity of two paddles and a bouncing ball, yet it held the power to transport players into a world of competition and excitement.",
	"spatial": "In a distant future, humanity has colonized numerous planets and established communication networks across the galaxy. To entertain weary colonists and hardworking laborers, a space-based pong game was created, where players battle for supremacy in a zero-gravity environment.\n\nThe game was developed by a team of scientists and engineers who sought to harness the laws of gravity to create a unique challenge for players. At the center of the game is an artificial black hole that serves as the focal point for the game's gravity, deflecting the ball from its axis and adding an additional dimension of difficulty.\n\nPlayers who proved to be the best in the game quickly gained fame and prestige among space gaming communities. Tournaments began to be organized in space stations and planets across the galaxy, with players from all walks of life coming to compete for the title of Space Pong Champion.\n\nOver time, factions formed among the most talented players, each seeking to dominate the game of space pong. Rivalries emerged between these factions, and some even began to employ cunning tactics to gain an edge over their opponents.\n\nToday, the game of space pong has become a true galactic phenomenon, with thousands of passionate players battling for glory and recognition. But with stakes higher than ever and rivalries fiercer than ever, players must show finesse and strategy if they want to survive in the unforgiving universe of space pong."
